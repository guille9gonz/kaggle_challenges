## **Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk**
The goal of this competition is to use various factors to predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease. The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset.

### Project Structure
**``model1``**: Notebook containing all the steps to build a ML model: data analysis, preprocessing, model tuning and predictions.
**``model2``**: Working on it...

### Results
First model (Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting) scored 89.87% in training and **90.28%** at the submission CSV.
Accuracy could be improved with minor adjustments to data preprocessing.
